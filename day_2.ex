# You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take
# that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the
# left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If 
# there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

# [1,2,3,4,3,2,1] = 4
# [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] = -1
